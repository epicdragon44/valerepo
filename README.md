# Vale Repository
The Git repository for all the components of ValeOS, including the ISO files, the website, and the welcome app.

Note: The squashed file system (a compressed file that maps out the entire root directory of the operating system) is too large (1.3 gb) to fit on a normal Git repository. To get the file, download it from https://mega.nz/folder/8r4RySBJ#V7j2lkMbmsMngXho9Qt3yQ and copy it over into valeiso/casper/
