							Designed to be speedy: all bloat is removed and lightweight yet powerful applications are pre-bundled.
						</li>
							<li>
							Built on one of the most secure platforms: Security is a cornerstone of any Linux operating system. Each user is separated from other users and each has different levels of access rights. Combined with the open source format with many different system architectures, components and operating environments, it is extremely hard for malware to sweep across the computer. 
							</li>
						<li>
							Open source and customizable. Something that Linux prides itself in is being open source- meaning that the software can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone, in other words, a true form of free software. Companies like Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Redhat, Intel, and Oracle support Linux by continuously providing fixes as they use Linux for business. As a home user, you benefit from these continuous contributions by developers in terms of usability, security, and customization. 
						</li>
						<li>
							As a ValeOS user, you become a member of Linux and other open source communities that will provide mutual benefits to each other. Additionally, ValeOS is backed by Debian Ubuntu repositories, so your own customization can be as simple as a point-and-click away! 
						</li>
						<li>
							Update whenever you want: Bothered by incessant Windows Updates? ValeOS gives you the freedom to upgrade your software at your freedom, without compromising security.
